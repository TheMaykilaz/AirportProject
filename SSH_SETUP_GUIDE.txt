üóùÔ∏è MANUAL SSH KEY SETUP FOR AIRPORT PROJECT
==============================================

STEP 1: Generate SSH Key
------------------------
Open Command Prompt (cmd) and run:
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "airport-project-key" -f "C:\Users\Nadia\.ssh\id_rsa"

Press Enter when prompted for:
- File location (should default to C:\Users\Nadia\.ssh\id_rsa)
- Passphrase (press Enter twice for no passphrase)

STEP 2: Copy Your Public Key
----------------------------
Run this command to see your public key:
type C:\Users\Nadia\.ssh\id_rsa.pub

Copy the entire output (starts with "ssh-rsa" and ends with "airport-project-key")

STEP 3: Add Key to GitHub
-------------------------
1. Go to: https://github.com/settings/ssh
2. Click "New SSH key"
3. Title: "Airport Project Key"
4. Paste your public key in the "Key" field
5. Click "Add SSH key"

STEP 4: Update Git Remote
-------------------------
In your project directory, run:
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:TheMaykilaz/AirportProject.git

STEP 5: Test Connection
-----------------------
ssh -T git@github.com

You should see: "Hi TheMaykilaz! You've successfully authenticated..."

STEP 6: Push Your Code
----------------------
git push origin test-ci-pipeline

This will trigger your CI/CD pipeline! üöÄ

ALTERNATIVE: Use HTTPS with Personal Access Token
==================================================
If SSH doesn't work, you can use a Personal Access Token:

1. Go to: https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. Generate new token (classic)
3. Give it "repo" permissions
4. Use as password when pushing:
   git push https://YOUR_TOKEN@github.com/TheMaykilaz/AirportProject.git

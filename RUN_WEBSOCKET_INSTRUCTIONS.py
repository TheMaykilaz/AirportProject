Instructions for running Django with WebSocket support

The WebSocket issues have been fixed with the following changes:

1. ✅ Added 'channels' to INSTALLED_APPS
2. ✅ Added ASGI_APPLICATION setting
3. ✅ Added CHANNEL_LAYERS configuration
4. ✅ Added proper synchronization (asyncio.Lock) to prevent race conditions
5. ✅ Added timeout handling for AI responses

To run the application with WebSocket support, you have several options:

OPTION 1: Use Daphne (Recommended for development)
--------------------------------------------------
1. Install daphne: pip install daphne
2. Run: daphne -p 8000 AirplaneDJ.asgi:application

OPTION 2: Use Uvicorn
---------------------
1. Install uvicorn: pip install uvicorn
2. Set Django settings: export DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=AirplaneDJ.settings
3. Run: uvicorn AirplaneDJ.asgi:application --port 8000 --reload

OPTION 3: Use Django management command with channels
-----------------------------------------------------
If you have channels-devel installed:
1. pip install channels[devel]
2. python manage.py runserver 8000

Note: Regular Django runserver does NOT support WebSockets.

FIXES APPLIED:
=============

1. Race Condition Fix:
   - Added asyncio.Lock() in services.py to prevent multiple AI model access
   - Added timeout handling (30 seconds) in consumers.py
   - Improved error handling and fallback responses

2. WebSocket Configuration:
   - Added 'channels' to INSTALLED_APPS in settings.py
   - Added ASGI_APPLICATION = 'AirplaneDJ.asgi.application'
   - Added CHANNEL_LAYERS with InMemoryChannelLayer for development

3. Error Handling:
   - Better error messages when AI model is busy
   - Graceful fallback when AI model fails
   - Proper WebSocket connection status handling

The "Sorry, I encountered an error. Please try again." message should now only appear
in legitimate error cases, not due to race conditions when multiple users chat simultaneously.

TESTING:
========
After running with one of the ASGI servers above, you can:
1. Open http://localhost:8000/ai_chat/chat/ in multiple browsers
2. Send messages simultaneously from different browsers
3. Both should receive proper responses without the error message
